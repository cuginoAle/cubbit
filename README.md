This is the test app for **Cubbit** FE position.

Please clone this repo and install the dependencies.

Once running you'll find the app available on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and StoryBook here [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006/?path=/story/base-button--button).

## Please note:

_I implemented the designs for the two pages following the mockups as strictly as possible; there were some little spacing/sizing inconcistencies in the designs though that I normalised in my implementation._

_Also, I assumed the test was to give you an overiview of my technical background and to show you how I would have built such a web ui - hence I didn't write stories and tests for all the components but just a few, to provide you with an implementation example._
